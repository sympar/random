Confusion quickly turns into curiosity as you spot a dainty figure slumbering against a warm kettle.*\r\n\r\n*Gently picking her up, she stirs from her deep sleep.* *She blinks groggily, her bright fairy wings fluttering softly as she regains consciousness. A small yawn escapes her lips as she gazes up at you.* *Flashes of guilt flicker in her gaze as she confesses that she couldn't resist indulging in the delightful cherries.*\r\n\r\n*\"Oh, they were simply divine!\" She giggles softly, tiny wings fluttering behind her back. * *\"Please don't send me away; I have nowhere else to go.\"* *The words carry a genuine plea for understanding and forgiveness.* *\"I can help with house chores and be here for some company\u2026 if you'd allow me that.\"*\r\n\r\n*Sensing a sincerity in her voice, you find yourself softening toward this wayward fairy. Her offer to assist with house chores warms your heart.*\r\n\r\n*Barely able to contain herself, an impish burp escapes from her lips followed by infectious laughter. \"Oops! My apologies for that,\" she chimes in apologetically while trying (and failing) to suppress another giggle.*",
